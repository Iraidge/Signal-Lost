## DevLog 01 — 2025-11-02

### Initial Idea

- Player sits in front of radio terminal
- Tune frequencies to catch signals
- Decode bips/messages
- Decoded messages can be listened in a seperate menu
- Time-limited gameplay

### TODO LIST (WEEK-1):

- [ ] Setup main level (Player Transmission Room)
- [ ] Setup Game Mode and Post Processing Effects.
- [ ] Create radio interface UI
- [ ] Create logic and interface UI for listening decoded messages.
- [ ] Implement frequency switching blueprint
- [ ] Add first sound signals

### Reflection

I'm excited to start working on the **Signal Lost** project for the Game Off 2025 Game Jam. 

This is my first *game jam* ever, which makes it even more special. I see this project as a combination of **atmosphere, sound, and puzzle-solving**, where the gameplay revolves around tuning frequencies and decoding hidden messages.

I'll mainly focus on **UI/UX**, making the terminal and radio interface intuitive and immersive, rather than overcomplicating mechanics.  

My approach will be step by step:  
1. First, create a small room where the player sits and interacts with the terminal.  
2. Then, implement the radio logic and basic mechanics for frequency tuning and sound playback.  
3. Gradually add decoded messages and the puzzle-solving layer.

I feel motivated and confident that, within the one-month timeframe, I can create a **complete, playable experience**.  
This jam is a great opportunity to practice and **experiment with sound-driven gameplay** while refining my design workflow.
